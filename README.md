# How to Play Search App
<h2>Project Title</h2>
<p>'How to Play' Search App</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Sometimes we do not want to read lengthy 'How to play' or 'How to do' borochure and it is so much better to just watch a video to understand the rules. I imagined, it would be nice to have an application that do all the work for this situation using a barcode, more precisely, for this application, QR code.</p>

<h2>What this application does</h2>
<p>By scanning a QR code, you will get a search result from Youtube and Wikipedia. For example, if you scan a QR code which contains "Monopoly", you will get a bunch of videos on "How to play Monopoly" from Youtube and simple description from Wikipedia. </p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<h2>Further Possibilities </h2>
I found BarcodeLookup site(https://www.barcodelookup.com/) has enormous data on barcodes. Unfortunately, they only offer paid plans for API calls but the main concept would be the same as QR codes that I used for tests.
